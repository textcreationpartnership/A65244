            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WO, wo! to the Inhabitants of the earth, and all that have forgotten God, dayes without number; I will ariſe like a mighty man of War (ſaith the Lord); your day, your day, begins to gather blackneſs; Flee, flee, as on Eagles wings, for deſolation and deſolution haſteneth: Your day, your day, in what doth it ſet? Oh the night! oh the obſcurity! oh the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and anguiſh! the pain of ſoul and ſpirit, in your Suns going down, that is in wrath to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: My ſoul, my ſoul, my bowels, my bowels; I am grieved with pity, to ſee what haſteth, and is ready to overtake the world of ungodly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be, that are already in it. You ſwearers, drunkards, whoremongers, lyars, curſers, raylers, backbiters, perſecutors, ſlanderers, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them that are good; your day doth gather darkneſs, and a cry is gone over all that in which your ſouls doth delight, your glory is ſtained, and the beauty of your excellency marred: Repent, repent, before light be utterly extinguiſhed to ye, and the day and hour cometh, wherein it may be too late for ye (and that Gods ſoul hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ye, nor you in the overtakings of that day.)</p>
            <p>Therefore let not the day of your viſitation be ſlighted, and the mercy and loving kindneſſe of

            <p>This is the deſire of my ſoul, that all may come to the truth as it is in Jeſus. <hi>Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, the Life of God, and Light of men; and whoſoever followeth me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not abide in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life:</hi> So as you mind the witneſs of God <hi>(within)</hi> that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth manifeſt all the works of darkneſs; and as you joyn your minds to it, and love it, and obey it, it will let you ſee all your bad thoughts, and all that is out of the truth and way of God; and as you wait low in the fear of God, you will come to <hi>ſee whom ye have pierced, and to mourn over him bitterly, even as a man mourneth over his firſt born.</hi>

And to all you <hi>Mourners in Zion,</hi> a word from the Lord I have to you, <hi>you ſhall be comforted; and all you that ſow in tears, you ſhall reap with joy; for he that hath promiſed to come, will come, and bring his reward with him: For to them that ſear my Name, ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſſe ariſe, with healing in his wings: And they ſhall goe forth, and grow up as Calves for the ſtall: They ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord, in the day that I make up my Jewels; I will ſpare them, even as a man ſpareth his firſt-born.</hi> And ſo my dear Friends, Lift up your heads with Joy, for the day of your redemption draws nigh, and the Lord is riſen with Power, and with great Glory, and everlaſting praiſes be given to him for

Oh my dear Friends, it is the deſire of my ſoul, that you may all dwell upon the ſure Foundation of many Generations, that you may all come to eat of the Bread of Life, that you may all drink of the pure Fountain of Life, that you may all be cloathed with the Robes of Righteouſneſſe, and with the Garment of Praiſe, that the Lord may be glorified in his own work.</p>
